# pyautogui-bruteforce
This script automates brute forcing a text field through the gui for sites that do not have an invalid credentials timeout response.


INSTRUCTIONS:
3.	From a command prompt navigate into your new “Brooty” folder.
4.	From the Chrome or Internet Explorer web browser navigate to the site with the password text field you wish to brute force.
5.	Enter credentials into the “Username” field.
6.	From the command prompt type “brooty.py”.
7.	Press “OK” on popup.
8.	Click in “Password” field.
9.	After 5 seconds the script will enter in passwords until it runs through the full list.
10. It runs through these passwords at about 3 words a second. So it will run through the provided 6250 words in about 35 minutes.
11.	If you want to end the scripts before it is done with the password list click in the command prompt and press “CTRL C” until it exits.

Note 1: The program will keep running through CTRL A, enter password, press enter, commands if you click somewhere else on the screen so be careful.

Note 2: You can also open up a notepad and let the program run in there to see what it is doing.
